# Clean Camera Script for Godot 4.1+ with Smooth Momentum
# Purpose: Smooth rotation and zoom camera with momentum and easing (no floor clipping)
# Author: Thane
# Date: 2025-06-20
#
# Controls:
# - Right Mouse Button: Rotate camera around player (with smooth momentum)
# - Mouse Wheel: Zoom in/out (with smooth transitions)
# - R Key: Reset camera rotation
# - Camera maintains safe height and has phone-like smooth momentum
#
