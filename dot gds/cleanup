Godot GDScript Cleanup Template
1. Remove Debug/Print/Test Code

Delete all print(), push_error(), push_warning(), and similar debug/logging statements.
Remove any functions or code blocks used only for debugging or testing (e.g., debug_*, test_*, _verify_*, _spawn_debug_*, etc.).
2. Remove Redundant or Duplicate Systems

If a function or system is not called anywhere, remove it.
If there are multiple functions doing the same thing, merge them into one and update all references.
3. Remove Unused Variables and Parameters

Delete variables that are declared but never used.
For unused function parameters that must remain (e.g., for signal compatibility), prefix them with an underscore: _param.
4. Remove Unnecessary Comments and Disabled Code

Delete commented-out code and comments that are no longer relevant.
Remove TODOs and FIXMEs that are obsolete.
5. Simplify and Inline Where Possible

Inline simple wrapper functions if they are only used once or twice.
Remove unnecessary wrappers and stubs.
6. Remove Unused Exported Properties

If an exported property is not used in the script or scene, remove it.
